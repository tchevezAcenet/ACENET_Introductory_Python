    "A variable is a name that refers to a value. In the previous example, we saw that we can use Python as an advanced calculator. However, the results of these computations are lost after we perform our operations. If we want to save and reuse any value in a code, we need to save these computations in a place in computer memory to be able to access it in the future.\n",

We’ll use two ***Boolean*** flags for cold and high salinity conditions to keep track of whether we find these conditions. At the end, we’ll print a summary for each site to show if the conditions are *“normal,” “cold,” “high salinity,” or both*. \n",

    "### Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Data Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by organizing the information for each site. For each site (for example, \"Site A\" and \"Site B\"), include a list of depth measurements, each with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Depth in meters\n",
    "    - Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)\n",
    "    - Salinity in parts per thousand (ppt)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Here’s how your data might look:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Site A:\n",
    "  - Depth: 10m, Temperature: 15.0°C, Salinity: 33.0 ppt\n",
    "  - Depth: 50m, Temperature: 12.0°C, Salinity: 34.5 ppt\n",
    "  - Depth: 100m, Temperature: 8.5°C, Salinity: 36.0 ppt\n",
    "\n",
    "Site B:\n",
    "  - Depth: 10m, Temperature: 14.0°C, Salinity: 32.5 ppt\n",
    "  - Depth: 50m, Temperature: 11.5°C, Salinity: 33.8 ppt\n",
    "  - Depth: 100m, Temperature: 9.0°C, Salinity: 35.5 ppt\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up for Each Site:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once your data is organized, start analyzing each site.\n",
    "- Print a message saying you’re beginning analysis for the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyze Each Depth Measurement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through each measurement for the site, reviewing the depth, temperature, and salinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Totals for Temperature and Salinity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you go through each reading, add up the temperature and salinity values. This will help you calculate the average for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Identify Special Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- While analyzing each reading, check if:\n",
    "    - The temperature is below 10°C. If so, note that the site has a “cold zone.”\n",
    "    - The salinity is above 35 ppt. If so, note that the site has a “high salinity zone.”\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculate Averages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- After analyzing all the readings for a site, calculate the average temperature and salinity by dividing each total by the number of measurements. Print these averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Summarize Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the conditions noted, summarize the results for each site:\n",
    "    - If both conditions were noted, state that the site has both cold and high salinity conditions.\n",
    "    - If only one condition is met, specify whether it’s a “cold zone” or “high salinity zone.”\n",
    "    - If neither condition is present, state that the site has “normal conditions.”"
